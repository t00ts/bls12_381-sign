# gRPC Client for BLS12-381 Sign

Implementation of a simple IPC-based server to provide a synchronous gRPC interface to the [BLS12-381 library](https://github.com/bls12_381-sign/rust/bls12_381-sign) to external parties.

## API definition
We use protobuf to strictly define the API. The schema is available [here](https://github.com/bls12_381-sign/schema/bls12381sig.proto).

## Building

`Makefile` at the repo root takes care of everything. Regardless, a simple `cargo build --release` should do the job if built independently. Built service binaries can be found at `./target/release`

## Usage

We provide a bloat-free [example](https://github.com/t00ts/bls12_381-sign/go/grpc) of a client written in Go which fully describes all API methods that can be used for reference.
